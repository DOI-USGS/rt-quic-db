Manage Plate Templates
======================
This activity is used to create, edit, or delete plate template records. A plate template is a record that specifies
the type of plate used for a particular assay.

Go to Admin > Manage Plate Templates in the navigation bar.

To create a new plate template, press "Create new template". The selection will display "Creating new record...", indicating
that you are creating a new plate template record. Enter the plate name and other desired fields. Press "Submit new template"
to create the new record.

To edit a plate template, select the name of the template you wish to edit. The fields will populate with
their existing values.

Make any desired changes and then press "Update template" to save the changes.

To delete a plate template, select the name of the template you wish to delete, then press "Delete template". (This is only possible
if you have been granted security by your Team Admin to delete plate templates.)

If at any time you wish to cancel changes or select a different plate template, press the "Cancel selection" link at the bottom of the window.
