Introduction
============
Purpose
-------
Quake supports scientists and laboratory personnel involved in prion surveillance and research.

Laboratories around the world utilize real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) as a highly sensitive laboratory assay for the detection of prions. Quake is a web-based application for storing, visualizing, and analyzing RT-QuIC data.

As a cloud-hosted application connected to a cloud-hosted MySQL database, Quake enables assay results to be pooled across multiple individuals and research locations. 
Researchers can easily share data, which we hope may advance the science of prion surveillance by facilitating data exploration and hypothesis generation.

This is a exciting, growing project that was first created in the summer of 2020. If you are part of an organization that generates and analyzes RT-QuIC data, please drop us a line if you are interested in collaborating!
We want to know about your important use cases and desired features so that we can develop an application that will be broadly usable by the community.

Features
--------
- Management of new users, laboratory locations, samples, plate templates, and assays
- Upload assay data directly from the .csv output of the RT-QuIC plate reader
- Visualize fluorescence curves
- Select and modify well-level metadata

Getting Started

Contribute
----------
We aspire to continue adding essential features to Quake. We want to make it easy and fun to use. And we want to leverage the Python ecosystem to incorporate powerful machine learning analytics.
