Using the Well Editor
=====================
The Well Edit feature is used to modify well-level metadata. In particular, it can be used to assign sample records
to individual wells.

Go to Analysis > View Assay in the navigation bar. Select the name of the assay you wish to work with. Under "Well name",
leave the selection to "-- All --" and press "Get chart". This will display thumbnail fluorescence curves for all wells
in the assay.

Left click on one or more wells to select them, then right-click and select "Well Edit":

      :alt: Wells selected
      :align: center

The Well Edit window displays metadata for the selected wells. If a data field is not specified for any of the selected
wells, "Unspecified" will appear in the field. If multiple wells are selected and they have different values for a
particular field, "Multiple values selected" will appear in the field.

Setting or changing a value of a field in Well Edit will update that field's value for all selected wells.

Once a field has been specified for a particular well, the value of that field can be changed but not deleted using Well Edit.
