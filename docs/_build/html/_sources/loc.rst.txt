Manage Locations
================
This activity is used to create, edit, or delete location records. A location is a physical or logical subdivision of
your research team. When a user uploads data, they will specify with which location the data is affiliated.

Go to Admin > Manage Location in the navigation bar.

To create a new location, press "Create new location". The selection will display "Creating new record...", indicating
that you are creating a new location record. Enter the location name, address, city, state, and ZIP code. Press "Submit new location"
to create the new record.

To edit a location, select the name of the location you wish to edit. The fields will populate with
their existing values.

Make any desired changes and then press "Update location" to save the changes.

To delete a location, select the name of the location you wish to delete, then press "Delete location". (This is only possible
if you have been granted security by your Team Admin to delete locations.)

If at any time you wish to cancel changes or select a different location, press the "Cancel selection" link at the bottom of the window.
