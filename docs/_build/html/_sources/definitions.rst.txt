Research Team
-------------
A **research team** is a group of users who generally want to see and work with each other's data, but do not want users
outside of their team to have data access.

We do not intend now for it to be possible to subdivide a research team into different subgroups that cannot see each
other’s data – if that were the case, then they should register as different research teams, and be managed separately.
The exception to this is that some users can be restricted to only edit or delete data that they create.

Team Admin
----------
A **Team Admin** is a member of the research team with full access to Quake, who is responsible for configuring locations,
plate templates, and user security. In particular, the Team Admin must activate new users before they can log in, and
decide what each user will be able to do in Quake by assigning them **security points**. The Team Admin may assign
administrative privileges to other users on their team.

Locations
---------
**Locations** can be used to designate physical or logical subdivisions within your research team. When a user uploads
data, they will specify with which location the data is affiliated. While privacy and access
is controlled at the team level, locations can be useful for auditing and reporting purposes.

Plate Templates
---------------
A **plate template** is a record that specifies the type of plate used for a particular assay. For example, your system may
have a plate template for a 96-well plate with a specified number of rows and columns.

Samples
-------
A **sample** is a record of the material in each well of each specific assay. It contains a record of the name, species, sex, age,
and tissue matrix used in that particular well.

There is flexibility for your team in how granular you want to be with sample designation. For example, you may want to
include a generic "bovine" sample record that gets reused across many assays. Or, you may wish to create different sample
records for each logically different bovine sample. Please contact your Team Admin if you are unsure how your team is
using sample records in Quake.

Assays
------
An **assay** represents one particular run of a plate in the RT-QuIC analyzer. It is associated with a particular location
and plate template. Each well can be associated with a different sample.
