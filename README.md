# Quake
Laboratories around the world utilize real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) as a highly sensitive laboratory assay for the detection of prions. Quake is a web-based application for storing, visualizing, and analyzing RT-QuIC data. This functionality supports scientists and laboratory personnel involved in prion surveillance and research.
