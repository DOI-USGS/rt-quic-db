  <h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
  <p class="lead"> Edit Menu<p>
  
  <p> The Edit menu contains tools for managing samples, plate templates, and samples.
  However, an appropriate location and standard plate template have already been created, so you likely will only need to ensure that a sample record is created to use with your assay. </p>
  
  <p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px"> <b>Step 1.</b> Go to Edit > Manage Samples, click "Create new sample", type in the details for your sample, and then click the "Submit new sample" button at the bottom. Note that if an appropriate
  sample record already exists, then you do not need to complete this step. </p>
  
  <br>
  <div class="img-container" style="text-align:center">

	</div>
  <br>
  
  <p class="lead"> Upload Assay<p>
  
  <p> Now you will create a new assay using a .csv file taken from the analyzer's output. The Upload Assay tool is also housed in the Edit menu.</p>
  
  <p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px"> <b>Step 2.</b> Go to Edit > Upload Assay. Ensure that the 96-well plate template and your location is selected. 
  (The sample is not associated with the assay. Instead, it is assigned to each well in Well Edit after the upload is complete.)
  Enter an assay name
  and any other parameters that should apply to all wells in the assay. Press the Browse button at the bottom right to select the .csv file from your local file system. 
  Press "Create assay" to upload. Note that 
  this will take around 30-60 seconds to complete. </p>
  
  <br>
  <div class="img-container" style="text-align:center">

	</div>
  <br>
  
  <p class="lead"> View Assay and Well Edit<p>
  
  <p> Finally, you will be able to view the assay and make edits to individual wells.
  
  <p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px"> <b>Step 3.</b> Go to Analysis > View Assay, select your assay and all wells, and click Get Chart. You will see a grid of all IF curves.</p>
  
  <p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px"> <b>Step 4.</b> Left-click to select one or more wells, then right-click and go to Well Edit to change the properties of those specific wells. For example,
  this is where samples may be assigned to wells.<p/>
